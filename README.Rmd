`biomech` helps to compute bending and torsion of beams following the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. It is specifically designed to be applied on
tree branches (or e.g. palm leaves), but can be applyied to any other beam-shaped structure.

## Installation

You can install biomech from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PalmStudio/biomech")
```

## Example

Here is an example usage:

```{r example}
library(biomech)
file_path = system.file("extdata/6_EW01.22_17_kanan.txt", package = "biomech")
field_data = read_mat(file_path)
# Un-bending the field measurements:
df_unbent = unbend(field_data)

# Adding the distance of application of the left and right weight:
df_unbent$distance_application = distance_weight_sine(df_unbent$x)

# (Re-)computing the deformation:
df_bent = bend(df_unbent, elastic_modulus = 1200, shear_modulus = 100, step = 0.02, points = 100, iterations = 15, verbose = TRUE)

df_bent
```

You can plot the results using:

```{r}
plot_bending(Observed = field_data, "Un-Bent obs." = df_unbent, Modeled = df_bent)
```

Note that the `unbent` argument is optional but can be very usefull to compare with the initial conditions.

You can even make 3d plots using `plot_bent_3d()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_bending_3d(Observed = field_data, "Un-Bent obs." = df_unbent, Modeled = df_bent)
```
