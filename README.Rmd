`biomech` helps to compute bending and torsion of beams following the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. It is specifically designed to be applied on
tree branches (or e.g. palm leaves), but can be applyied to any other beam-shaped structure.

## Installation

You can install biomech from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PalmStudio/biomech")
```

## Example

Here is an example usage:

```{r example}
library(biomech)
filepath = system.file("extdata/6_EW01.22_17_kanan.txt", package = "biomech")
# Un-bending the field measurements:
df = unbend(2000,400, read_mat(filepath))

# (Re-)computing the deformation:
bend(df, step = 0.02, points = 100, iterations = 15, verbose = TRUE)
```
